# Mini Facebook (Django)

This project is a miniature Facebook-like web application built using Django. It allows users to create profiles, post status messages, upload images, manage friendships, and view a custom news feed. The app supports user authentication and was developed incrementally through multiple feature-based assignments.

## Overview

The Mini Facebook app enables users to:
- Create and update personal profiles
- Post and edit status updates with image uploads
- Add and view friends
- Get friend suggestions
- See a personalized news feed
- Register, log in, and log out securely

This Django project leverages Djangoâ€™s class-based views, form handling, and ORM features to provide a full-stack social experience.
